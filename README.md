# dndCharacterRoller

This is an app for building a DND character

I'm going to try to be consistent and follow my own rules for programming. MVC, only factories(save for library specific), and TDD.

I'm going to be using Express, Sequelize, and Jest for this. The decision to use Sequelize is just to get additional practice with the library to increase my knowledge when teaching it. I have not decided what the front end will look like yet, nor if I will be using React.
